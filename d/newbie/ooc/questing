Concerning questing...

1.) How many quests do I have to do?
 
In Sundering Shadows all quests are entirely optional.
You do not have to do quests to advance in levels. However, quests will grant a reward of ability, xp, items,
treasure, etc., for being completed and generally are something worth
solving if you can or so desire.
